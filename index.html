              <h3>Coffee Shop Ordering System</h3>
              <p>
               <b>Motivation of the project</b>
                The reason why I pick this is because that Ordering system is pretty common in our daily life
                and I want to challenge myself to see if I can do one by myself.
                Turns about I have a basic structure of how it flow but still need a lot of implementation to make it really useable in real life
                But I am glad that I did this because I learn a lot from this by optimize it visually in GUI
                The step for using it is simple as well
                For the text-base, basically it will be asking what wouuld you want ,and you only need to type the correspoinding number and message into it.
                For the GUI, we have three different pages, the first one need you to input you name, and click next
                the second page have what type of coffee you would like and what size you would like.
                then the third page is any additional information that you would like to add, like milk percentage, hot or cold, what milk you prefer, and what topping youw would like to add
                and through 2 and 3 page, you have the ability to click back button to go back to the previous page to change whatever you would like, and all the infomation you have added it will be saved.
                No need to worry to type it again.
              </p>
              <p>
              <b>Functional requirements/what the project does</b>
                This project is a simple ordering and selecting project.
                I have divided the project interaction in two different part
                First one is text base input and output. It still contains more problem than the GUI one, but it is runnable. User need to follow strictly from the input suggestion or it will be crushed.
                The second one is GUI, which is more visually and user-friendly. It also give user option to go back to change what they did to something new and printed out better script.
                I would personally recommend the GUI one. The format is clean and simple, and it gives more space for user to put information they prefer and least unlikely to crushed.
              </p>
              <p>
              <b>Project design</b>
                The design of this project is simple.
                First we need to have a framework, what do we want our system doing, and what type of information that we would like to include
                such as anything included with coffee, milk, coffee beans, price, ice, hot or cold, topping and so on.
                I decided use java since my whole semester being writing this so I using java and JFrame which is already implemented when I pick java, no more dependency required
                So based on the project we wrote before, I go alone the basic idea we have: interfaces, abstract class, concrete class.
                The whole structure of the project is clear and straight out.
                Because it is too simple, this project is missing a bit for its functions, I still have few thoughts that I would like to implement but I kinda run out of my time so this is as far as I can go by myself.
              </p>
              <p>
              <b>Implementation</b>
                I did this project alone, to be honest, this is not a very hard or complex programming project
                I did a little advance or improve it better by reforming it or presenting it in GUI
                which visually provides better and release me for some error handling.
                I used Java to implement this project, and I used Java Swing to create the GUI. Which decrease further more dependency that is required.
